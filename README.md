# 16-bit CPU Project (In Progress)

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop a 16-bit CPU using Verilog, based on a flexible and evolving architecture. The primary goal is to create a versatile CPU that supports a range of arithmetic, logical, and memory operations, while also focusing on efficiency and optimization techniques. The project is in its initial stages, with the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) already implemented and serving as the foundation for further CPU development.

## Project Vision
The objective is to build a robust CPU capable of handling a wide variety of instructions with efficient data processing capabilities. This architecture will be adaptable, and additional features will be integrated as the design evolves. We are open to expanding the CPU's capabilities and exploring new design possibilities as the project progresses.

## Current Progress

### Completed Components
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: The ALU currently supports the following operations:
  - **Arithmetic operations**: ADD, SUB
  - **Logical operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
  - **Bitwise operations**: Shift and Set Less Than

- **Register File**:The Register File currently supports the following operations:
  - **Write Operation**: Write data to a specified register when enabled.
  - **Read Operations**: Read data from two specified registers.

  

### Upcoming Components
The following modules are planned for future development to enhance the CPU's capabilities:

- **Control Unit**: To manage instruction decoding and control signals.
- **Hazard Detection**: Mechanisms to address potential hazards during instruction execution.
- **Memory Interface**: For seamless interaction with instruction and data memory.
- **Instruction Set**: Expansion to support more complex operations and instructions.

## Planned Features
The CPU design will likely include, but is not limited to, the following features:

- **16-bit data path** for a balance between complexity and performance.
- **Flexible instruction set** supporting various data manipulation and memory operations.
- Support for both **R-type and I-type instructions**, with potential future expansion.
- **Load and Store operations** to interact with memory effectively.
- **Scalability** to accommodate future enhancements like additional registers or extended word sizes.
- **Optimization techniques** to handle control flow and data hazards efficiently.

## Simulation and Testing

### Testbench Strategy
A comprehensive testbench will be developed to verify the functionality of the CPU at every stage of its design. The testbench will generate a variety of instructions, stimulate the CPU's operation, and validate its outputs to ensure correct behavior.

The testbench will focus on:
- **Validating arithmetic and logical operations** performed by the ALU.
- **Monitoring control signals** to ensure accurate instruction execution.
- **Detecting and debugging issues** in data handling and memory operations.

### Simulation Tools
We plan to use Verilog simulation tools like ModelSim or Icarus Verilog for compiling and running the testbench. Waveform viewers like GTKWave will be used to visualize internal signals and debug the CPU's behavior.

## Future Enhancements
As the project evolves, the following potential enhancements will be considered:

- **Advanced branching and control flow mechanisms** for efficient execution.
- **Support for floating-point operations** for more complex computations.
- **Introduction of cache memory** to improve data access speeds.
- **Extending the architecture** to support 32-bit or 64-bit operations.
- **Interrupt handling and exception management** to make the CPU more robust.
- **Forwarding and hazard control** to reduce pipeline stalls and optimize performance.
